TABSPACE_FEATURE=This is the feature that makes Sielo so special. With tabs spaces you can divide your Sielo window into several spaces, as if you had several windows next to each other but still interacting with each others. You can resize your tabs spaces, hide them, mute them... This makes possible, among other things, to have several sessions, for example a session called "social networks", another called "music" and another called "work". Therefore you can hide the "music" tabs space and retrieve it at any time.
FLOATING_TITLE=Floating buttons
FLOATING_PRESENTATION=Be more efficient and gain place with floating button
FLOATING_FEATURE=This is another specific feature of Sielo, with it, you can gain space by dematerialising the browser's toolbar. Being a simple mobile button, it gives you access to all the needed controls during your browsing and can adapt itself to your workspace.
